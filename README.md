# portfolio-website

I built this portfolio website to showcase my skills, experience, and projects to potential clients and employers. I wanted to demonstrate my work in a visually appealing and organized manner, while also providing easy access to my contact information. I build this website with React and it is hosted on GitHub pages [here](https://kfc-manager.github.io/portfolio-website/).
